replace entity_t with raw structs.
instead of using entity_t and what now. in functions just pass the values that are needed.

doors are portals, which load the each chunk based on its portal offset.

portal min and max:
{
	min: 8 7 -13
	max: 8 7 2
}

add block generator for cubes, circles, spheres, triangles and create blocks from a heightmap.

have one world and segment it into chunk sections on init, this will simplify world editing
bacause you wont have to select the current entity or whatever.
